RESTY server
============

This is a basic restful server based on express.  As it is being used as a demonstration system for various principles, its functionality is distributed amongst several branches.  The final version is expected to include a REST resource, a non-REST resource, authentication for non-idempotent operations, and an angular frontend.  All basic functions are unit-tested through mocha-chai (server) or karma-phantomjs (frontend).
